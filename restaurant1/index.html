        <p>Restaurant Description<br />
            "Welcome to Matt's Burger Shack on Spruce Street, where good food and even better customer service meet for a luncheon with friends, catching up with family, or a romantic night out. We are Michelin rated with three stars for our excellent cuisine. Our chefs come from top rated kitchens under the apprenticeship of famous cooks like Gordon Ramsey, Bobby Flay, and Wolfgang Puck. We encourage anyone to try our house specialty burger made with our special, proprietary garlic aioli sauce, cheddar cheese, and topped with crisp lettuce and even crisper, slow-cooked bacon. Advance notice on reservations typically need to be 2 weeks in advance, especially during the Summer. We hope to see you soon." </p>
