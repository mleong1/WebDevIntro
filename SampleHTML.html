        <ul>
            <li>Tags are not displayed by the browser but tell the browser how to process content or what they represent.</li>
            <li>HTML document is a collection of nested HTML tags that describe how the browser should read the content. Handles
                structure of the document.</li>
            <li>Head element handles the words inside of the tab in the browser (Probably where favicons go too).</li>
            <li>Doctype confirms that the document follows HTML5.</li>
            <li style="color: red">Attribute is an extra piece of information in a tag to give it definition, context, or identity.
                EX. id =</li>
            <li>Formatting tags include <b>bold</b>, <strong>strong</strong>, <i>italics</i>, <em>emphasis</em>, superscript
                (ex. n<sup>2</sup>), and subscript (ex. H<sub>2</sub>O).</li>
            <li><ins>Inserted text?</ins> and <del>deleted text</del> and <mark>marked text</mark>.</li>
            <li><code>public static void main(String args[]){<br>
                        System.out.println("Hello world!")<br>
                      }</code></li>
            <li><!--A secret li that you would need to go to the code for.--></li>
            <li><a href="portfolio/index.html">Link to code along 2.</a></li>
            <li>A website's homepage can have one of three filenames: index.html, home.html, or default.html.</li>
            <li>Block elements create a block of content in its parent started on a newline. Paragraphs, divs, head, body, etc. </li>
            <li>Content to be seen in the browser must be in the body.SS</li>
            <li>Semantic elements (footer, header, article, section, main) are just divs that are named so that you can organize
            css and js better and also help organize the items.</li>
            <li>HTML code characters always start with the & (ampersand) symbol and end with ; (semi-colon). &copy</li>
            <li>Inline element must be nested in a block element and does not take up horizontal width of parent container.
            Span is the inline Div.</li>
            <li>Anchor elements identifies content that a user can click to open a separate page.</li>
            <li>Target attribute for anchor tag defines how the linked content will open. This is how you have an anchor tag
            open to a new tab.</li>
            <li>Internal links use relative paths to the file you are linking to.</li>
            <li>Specifying only height or width resizes the image while maintaining the aspect ratio.</li>
            <li>Definition list is the 3rd list I had never heard of. DT to create thing to be defined and DD for the definition.</li>
            <li>Input tag is very versatile and can take many forms based off of the attribute tag like text, radio or submit.</li>
            <li>Some HTML elements have different states (when you hover over a link). Pseudo classes let you style those states.</li>
            <li>For links and their pseudo classes, they should be styled in the order of link, visited, hover, active.</li>

        <h2>Important points from the CSS course</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>While HTML handles structure of document, CSS handles how it looks and is laid out.</li>
            <li>CSS rule set is the block of code that handles all of the styling for an HTML element or group of elements.</li>
            <li>CSS selectors: (. for class, # for id, and nothing for an existing html element.</li>
            <li>CSS declarations end in semi-colons ;</li>
            <li>CSS declarations are made of of properties and values. Name the property and then the value that you want the property set to. Color: red;</li>
            <li>Same comments as Java, /* */</li>
            <li>Applying styling to multiple elements is very DRY so we don't repeat code everywhere and then have to clean it up if it goes wrong.</li>
            <li>Formatting applied to parent elements is applied to children and nested elements. Inline elements in a paragraph for instance.</li>
            <li>You can list elements by comma separating them so that CSS styling is applied to multiple selected elements.</li>
            <li>Inline styling is when you use the style attribute of a HTML element. Internal style sheet is a set of rules applied to the head element (page specific). External style sheet is a separate .css file used to format a page applied via style link.</li>
            <li>Inline styles take precedence over the other methods.</li>
            <li>Padding is whitespace around the content in the border, the border is the literal border around the content, and the margin is the whitespace around the border.</li>
            <li>Fixed values are a measurement of pixels. Relative values are percentages of parent elements.</li>
            <li>Padding takes fixed lengths. There is a padding-top, padding-left, padding-right, and a padding-bottom. You can also use padding: 5px, 15px, 15px, 5px to set top, right, bottom left. Or you can use padding: 5px to set all sides.</li>
            <li>Border also lets you specify all 4 directions. You can specify a thickness, style, and a color.</li>
            <li>Margin is the same as padding just outside of the border.</li>
            <li>Formula for the height of an element: margin-top + border-top + padding-top + (height of the content) + padding-bottom + border-bottom + margin-bottom </li>
            <li>Formula for the width: margin-left + border-left + padding-left + (width of the content) + padding-right + border-right + margin-right</li>
            <li>Keep contrast up between font and background color. Light font on a dark background or vice versa.</li>
            <li>Background shorthand: background: color image repeat attachment position;</li>
            <li style="color: red">Color specifically only changes text color.</li>
            <li>The CSS attribute text-align allows us to align text to the left of the page, to the right, centered, or justifed.</li>
            <li>If you use fixed sizes like pixels (px) or points (pt) instead, you run the risk of having very large fonts on small screens or very small fonts on larger screens.</li>
            <li>If you include two selectors separated by a space (instead of a comma), the first selector is the parent of the second selector, and the style will apply only to children of that parent. In this case, the notation tfoot td means "td elements inside a tfoot element," and the style will not apply to other td elements in the table.</li>
            <li>Thead contains the head row and TBody contains the body rows.</li>
            <li>Caption needs to be in the table element.</li>
            <li>Margin: auto will center the block.</li>
            <li>It is common to use a width between 900 and 1200 pixels.</li>
            <li>We can turn off the float setting using the declaration clear:both, which tells the browser to turn off any floats (left or right) that are currently in effect.</li>
            <li>Paragraph are easier to wrap around floated elements than lists or tables.</li>
            <li>Bootstrap is a CSS framework that has already built out CSS structures for usage. Built on jQuery.js and popper.js.</li
            >
            <li>Bootstrap is probably so popular because it prioritizes mobile first development since we browse so much on smartphones today.</li>
            <li> CDN stands for Content Delivery Network, and it is a widely-used option for incorporating a framework like jQuery or Bootstrap into a website.</li>
            <li>In order for Bootstrap JavaScript to work, you must add jQuery and popper.js to your website, BEFORE adding Bootstrap. This is most likely because bootstrap calls code in those JS frameworks.</li>
            <li>Meta tag is used to provide info on the webpage. Charset tells us the character set used on the page. Viewport tells the browser to look at the user's window to determine how to apply Bootstraps media queries. Tags added to this sample page.</li>

                    <li>Common practice to add JS files to just before the /body tag so that the user can see and use the HTML content while the browser is loading the JS in the background.</li>
                    <li>Responsive design is to account for your user's use cases which means using programming to handle when a use case arises. Design for all contingencies and browsers. This often is talking about resizing based on browser (mobile, web).</li>
                    <li>To be mobile first, we need to leverage Bootstraps container class divs and its 12 column grid system.</li>
                    <li>Media queries are used in CSS to apply styles based on conditions like size of the viewport or device, orientation (landscape, portrait mode) or type of screen.</li>
                    <li>Container vs container fluid is what is going to control whether the cells stack when the page is resized or if the cells just get more narrow in the grid system.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Only columns may be immediate children of rows.</li>
            <li>Grid breakpoints are based on minimum width media queries, so they apply to that breakpoint and all of those above it. So if you just specify col-md-4, it will allot that space for the large breakpoint.</li>
            <li>Bootstrap rewrites the default font for headings, text, inline elements, and lists.</li>
            <li>Bootstrap makes tables easier with built in classes for alternating row styling, fixing borders, or adding color to tr and td elements.</li>

    <div class="javascript">
        <h2>Important points on javascript.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>JS is a programming language written in 1995 for the Netscape browser. It does things and handles actions on the page. It is the verb while HTML is the noun and CSS is the adjective.</li>
            <li>Javascript's name was meant to ride the success of Java, plus it received a trademark license from Sun Microsystems.</li>
            <li>JS was originally made to run in the browser to handle animations and interactivity. Now we have Node.js which lets you run JS outside of the browser and use it like a regular programming language to handle server side logic.</li>
            <li>Usually recommended that script elements be added at the end of the body element to improve user experience, especially when they are relatively long or there are multiple external scripts. The browser will read everything in the head element before it starts loading the content in the body section, and if there is a lot of JavaScript code, the user will perceive a lag while waiting for the page to load.</li>
            <li>There are 6 primitive data types number, string, boolean, undefined, null, and symbol (new to JS 2015).</li>
            <li>To create a string that has quotes in it, use either single quotes or double quotes around the string depending on which quotation mark is used in the string.</li>
            <li>Backslash is the escape character. /n is new line.</li>
            <li>Strictly equal to (===) is more strict and should be used over double equals. Double equal checks both sides, and if they are of different types, JS will convert one and check if they are equal. Hence === may be better in that it will strictly check if the number 3 is equal to the number 3. The number 3 will not equal the string 3 with ===.</li>
            <li>Declaring a variable in the console does not actually create any output, just the variable.</li>
            <li>Expressions are pieces of code that return values, while statements do actions like declaring a variable.</li>
            <li>JS is case sensitive. CamelCase is common as a convention for naming variables.</li>
            <li>Unary operators work on one variable and not two like ++. They also don't work on values.</li>
            <li>A conditional statement is a piece of code that controls another block of code getting executed if a condition is met.</li>
            <li>If a case 's block of code is executed and there is no break keyword at the end of its code block, all of the following cases' code blocks will be executed. This is known as "falling through" the switch.</li>
            <li>A well-designed while loop typically contains a statement inside to alter the test condition so that the loop eventually ends.</li>
            <li>Functions are blocks of code that can be called. It isolates functionality to its own statement. DRY.</li>
            <li>Parameters are the variables passed in to the function declaration. They represent your arguments. Arguments are the values used when the function is called.</li>
            <li>Nested function calls are resolved from the inside out.</li>
            <li>Var arr = new Array(); init statement</li>
            <li>Unshift add an element to the beginning of an array. Push add an element to the end of an array. Shift removes the first elem pop removes the last.</li>
            <li>Splice(0,2) get items from the starting point 1 up to index 2. So return index 0 and 1. Splice(i, j) changes the array and returns the same array with the elements from index i up to index j removed.</li>
            <li>A loaded HTML page is considered a document object. It follows the document object model and can be interacted with via JS. </li>
            <li>Some DOM collections include anchors, cookies, embeds, forms, images, etc. Can access via ex. document.anchors.</li>
            <li>Events are things that can be listened for to trigger JS code.</li>
            <li>Onload event is typically tied to the body and happens once the element loads.</li>
        </ul>
